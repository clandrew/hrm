# Human Resource Machine Solutions
These are my solutions to the programming-themed game Human Resource Machine.

You can import them into the game by selecting the code and then clicking the "Paste" button on the game's editor. Due to the nature of some of the problems, some of them have size and speed optimizations split up into separate programs.

The solutions cover **all** size and speed optimizations for **all** levels. Enjoy!
