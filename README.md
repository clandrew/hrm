# Human Resource Machine Solutions
These are my solutions to the programming-themed game Human Resource Machine.

The solutions cover all levels.

Due to the open-endedness of the problem-solving aspects of this game, other people may have found found a solution that also works well, or may work better. All the same, these cover all size and speed optimizations plus some commentary about the approach. Enjoy.

## 1 - Mail Room
This is a tutorial level intended to get you acquainted with some commands.

```
01 ğŸ¡†inbox

02 outboxğŸ¡†

03 ğŸ¡†inbox

04 outboxğŸ¡†

05 ğŸ¡†inbox

06 outboxğŸ¡†
```

## 2 - Busy Mail Room (size)
Another tutorial level where they teach you how to use the JUMP command. Using the JUMP will land you into the size optimization.

```
start:

01 ğŸ¡†inbox

02 outboxğŸ¡†

03 jump start
```


## 2 - Busy Mail Room (speed)
You can use JUMP, but you don't have to. You can exploit the fact that the game will only send you a fixed number of inputs.

```
01 ğŸ¡†inbox

02 outboxğŸ¡†

03 ğŸ¡†inbox

04 outboxğŸ¡†

05 ğŸ¡†inbox

06 outboxğŸ¡†

07 ğŸ¡†inbox

08 outboxğŸ¡†

09 ğŸ¡†inbox

10 outboxğŸ¡†
```
